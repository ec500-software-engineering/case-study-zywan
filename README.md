Analyze the package in your own words, 5-10 pages total, a concise analysis without vague generalities, including the following.     
## Technology and Platform used for development
1. What coding languages are used? Do you think the same languages would be used if the project was started today? What languages would you use for the project if starting it today?        


2. What build system is used (e.g. Bazel, CMake, Meson)? What build tools / environment are needed to build (e.g. does it require Visual Studio or just GCC or ?)        
 
 
3. What frameworks / libraries are used in the project? At least one of these projects donâ€™t use any external libraries or explicit threading, yet is noted for being the fastest in its category--in that case, what intrinsic language techniques is it using to get this speed.     


## Testing: describe unit/integration/module tests and the test framework
1. How are they ensuring the testing is meaningful? Do they have code coverage metrics for example?      


2. What CI platform(s) are they using (e.g. Travis-CI, AppVeyor)?     


3. What computing platform combinations are tested on their CI? E.g. Windows 10, Cygwin, Linux, Mac, GCC, Clang     

## Software architecture
1. How would you add / edit functionality if you wanted to? How would one use this project from external projects, or is it only usable as a standalone program?       


2. What parts of the software are asynchronous (if any)?    

3. Please make diagrams as appropriate for your explanation        

4. How are separation of concerns and information hiding handled?        

5. What architectural patterns are used         

6. Does the project lean more towards object oriented or functional components      

## Analyze two defects in the project
1. Does the issue require an architecture change, or is it just adding a new function or?      

2. make a patch / pull request for the project to fix problem / add feature      

## Demonstration application of the system
